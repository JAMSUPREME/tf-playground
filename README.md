# tf-playground
Little playground app for doing some terraform stuff

# Objective

We'll do a small practical dive into Terraform with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) since it has a very safe free tier.

# Prerequisites

1. Download Terraform 0.12.29 https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html (If you are on a mac, I recommend using Brew: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/terraform)
1. Make a new gmail account so you can safely make new stuff in isolation
1. Visit https://cloud.google.com/
1. Make a new project (e.g. "Terraform-PG"
1. Visit GCS (Google Cloud Storage): TODO link
1. Enable billing (don't worry, GCP won't bill you after the 12 months expire)
1. Make a bucket for storing your terraform state

Don't worry if you get stuck doing this, we'll go through it together anyway.
